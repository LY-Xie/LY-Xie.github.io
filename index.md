Welcome! I am a **PhD student at [the University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/)** supervised by Dr [Mingyuan Zhou](https://mingyuanzhou.github.io/). Before joining UT, I obtained my Bachelor's degrees in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics from [the University of California at Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/). My research interest lies in the grand topic of AI4Science, with a focus on **deep generative models for protein design** and **machine learning for biomedical sciences**.
